I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). Prior to this, I earned my PhD at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), supervised by [Prof. William J. Knottenbelt](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~wjk/). Previously, I obtained my Master’s degree, advised by [Prof. Qianhong Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=eEzaPPYAAAAJ), and my Bachelor’s degree from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/).


<!-- advised by [Prof. Qianhong Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=eEzaPPYAAAAJ), and  from École Centrale de Pékin, Beihang University.   -->

My research interests encompass privacy and security challenges in computer systems, with a particular focus on cryptography, blockchain, and their practical applications. Currently, I am exploring the following topics:

- <span style="font-size:0.9em;"> Blockchain privacy, security, consensus, and applications </span>
- <span style="font-size:0.9em;"> Applied cryptography, including classical and post-quantum solutions</span>
- <span style="font-size:0.9em;"> Decentralized Artificial Intelligence (DeAI)</span>
